Fix Democracy First
===================
This web site and platform supports uploading, approval and redistribution of videos answering the question: "Tell us your story of why we need to #FixDemocracyFirst." http://fixdemocracyfirst.us 

3rd-Party Depedencies
---------------------
1. [RVM](http://rvm.io)
1. [postgres](http://www.postgresql.org)
1. [redis](http://redis.io)
1. [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)

Do not proceed until you have all the dependencies installed and running. (On OSX, your best bet is to install postgres, redis and elastic search using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).)

Local Environment Setup
-----------------------
1. Clone the git repo
1. Install Ruby 2.2.1 on RVM: `rvm install 2.2.1`
1. Select the global gemset under ruby 2.2.1: `rvm use 2.2.1@fixdemocracyfirst`
1. Install Bundler in the global gemset: `gem install bundler`
1. Create a custom gemset for fixdemocracy: `rvm gemset create fixdemocracyfirst`
1. Select the gemset and ruby version: `rvm use 2.2.1@fixdemocracyfirst`
1. `cd` into your local git repo's directory
1. Run bundler: `bundle install`
1. Set environment variables for foreman by creating a `.env` file in your project directory with these variables (and ask one of us for the missing values so we can get them to you securely):

    ```
    S3_BUCKET=fixdemocracyfirst-stage
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
    AWS_REGION=us-west-1
    REDISTOGO_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/
    RAILS_RESQUE_REDIS=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/
    RESQUE_ADMIN_PASSWORD= #set this to whatever value you like
    SEARCHBOX_URL=http://localhost:9200
    JANRAIN_API_KEY=
    URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```
1. Create and seed the database: `foreman run bundle exec rake db:setup`
1. Start the server locally: `foreman run bundle exec rails s`
1. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
1. Create an account for yourself by visiting [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) and logging in with Facebook
1. Launch a rails console `foreman run bundle exec rails c` and execute this command to admin-ize your user account: `User.last.update_attribute(:admin, true)`

Note: When viewing the [Resque Web Console](http://localhost:3000/resque_web) for the first time, you'll receive a basic auth challenge. Respond with username `fixdemocracyfirst` and the password you set for `RESQUE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your .env file and ask the browser to remember your credentials (if you want).
